        <div>The controller package is the most important package UI-wise. It implements the controllers for the different pages and windows. They define part of the presentation and listen for events triggered by the user in order to perform the requested actions on the DB On Demand instances or on the user interface. A controller is defined for every main interface component, like a page or window inside a page. It uses almost every package in the application because this is where the core functionality resides (along with the util package). </div>
